# ðŸ§­ A guide to debugging with Jest

This guide sets out a testing-debugging methodology you can adopt to test and debug your code. It will involve using powerful tools like Jest and the built-in VSCode debugger to identify and explore program behaviour to debug software effectively. If these steps are followed rigorously, you can develop a great mental model for debugging code.

## ðŸ§ªÂ Identify and analyse the function youâ€™re testing

In the README, check the order of functions and identify which function youâ€™re testing. Read the function spec to familiarise yourself with the functionâ€™s intended behaviour.

## ðŸ“Œ Isolate and run tests

In Jest, we can use the `-t` flag to isolate specific test cases:

See this snippet from the docs:

Consider this test suite, we can isolate the tests to run all tests within the `describe` block.

We can use the command: `npm test -- -t "square function"`

For even more specificity, we can isolate specific test cases:

![isolate-test-block.png](assets/solate-test-block.png)

We can use a modified form of the command: `npm test â€”- -t "squares positive integers correctly"`

## ðŸ“• Read and interpret the tests

From reading the test feedback, double-check the following:

- Which line is the failing test on?
- What is the current output of the function?
- What is the expected output of the function?

## ðŸ”´Â Tell the debugger where to pause execution

We can [add breakpoints](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_breakpoints) to our program to tell it where to pause execution of our running program.

## ðŸ‘£Â Step through execution to check the program state during runtime

Next weâ€™ll run our tests in the JavaScript debug terminal - this means the tests will run but the debugger will pause execution at our breakpoints.

Open a **JavaScript Debug Terminal**

Now run the same test command as earlier - this time the debugger will pause execution at breakpoints in the code.

Now we can use the debug control panel to step through the execution of our code.
